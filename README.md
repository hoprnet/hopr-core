HOPR is a privacy-preserving messaging protocol that incentivizes users to participate in the network. It provides privacy by relaying messages via several relay nodes to the recipient. Relay nodes are getting paid via payment channels for their services.

For further details, see the [protocol specification on the wiki](../../wiki).

Note that the documentation is under active development and does not always represent the latest version of the protocol.

**Hint: There is a lot of development going on in our development → [branch](https://github.com/hoprnet/hopr-core/tree/jigsaw) ← !**

# Setup

## Dependencies

The current implementation of HOPR is in JavaScript so you need:
- [`Node.js`](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) 11
- [`yarn`](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install) >= 1.19.0

You might need to setup further operating system dependent, please refer to the wiki links below for more details: 
- [Ubuntu](../../wiki/Setup#Ubuntu)
- [macOS](../../wiki/Setup#macOS)
- [Windows](../../wiki/Setup#Windows)

## Get HOPR

Start by cloning this repository, let `yarn` install the dependencies and change the filename of the example settings file (don't worry, to do a quick local test you don't need to touch the content of the file and default settings work!):
```
$ git clone https://github.com/hoprnet/hopr-core.git
$ cd hopr-core

# in case you are using NVM (Node Versioning Manager), run the following two commands:
$ nvm install 11.15
$ nvm use

$ yarn install

$ mv .env.example .env
```

**DO NOT USE THE DEFAULT PRIVATE KEYS ON MAIN NET - YOU WILL LOOSE ALL FUNDS ASSOCIATED WITH THOSE KEYS!**

# Proof of Concept - Local Testnet

The following is an early and unstable proof of concept (PoC) running a *local* testnet which highlights the functionality of HOPR. Use it at your own risk. While we are giving our best to buidl a secure and privacy-preserving base layer of the web of today and tomorrow, we do not guarantee that your funds are safu and we do not guarantee that your communication is really metadata-private.

For the proof of concept, HOPR comes with a built-in chat client that is mostly used for demonstration purposes. It will not be part of HOPR in future releases.

To test everything locally, you will end up with 6 command line tabs (or separate windows):
1. Local Ethereum testnet (Ganache)
2. HOPR bootstrap node
3. HOPR node 0
4. HOPR node 1
5. HOPR node 2
6. HOPR node 3

The HOPR PoC chat app is configured to send messages via 2 intermediate relay nodes to the recipient, thus a total of 4 HOPR nodes is the bare minimum to run the PoC.

## Local Ethereum Node (Ganache)

To start a local Ganache-based testnet, run `yarn startTestnet`.

```
$ yarn startTestnet
// Successfully started local Ganache instance at 'ws://[::]:8545'.
```

## Deploy Contracts
Once Ganache is up and running, open another terminal (in many terminal applications you can simply open a new tab in the terminal via `[Command]` + `[t]`) and run `yarn deployContract` to deploy the smart contract. Just FYI, HOPR is using the account associated with the `FUND_ACCOUNT_PRIVATE_KEY` to deploy the smart contract. 

```
$ yarn deployContract
// Deployed contract on ganache at 0x4A3CDa9bbfc63ee1Db1fC749d86B769334fe27Fb
// Nonce is now 0.
```

You now have a blank version of the HOPR smart contracts running on your local Ganache node. You can keep using the same terminal for the bootstrap node. 

## Start Bootstrap Node
HOPR is a decentralized network, so in order to bootstrap the network and tell recently joined nodes about the participants of the network, there needs to be a bootstrap node that is known to all nodes. The default settings that in your `.env` file are pre-configured to work with the existing keys and is visible to other HOPR nodes running on the same machine, so you can just start it.

To start a bootstrap node, run `node hopr -b`

```
$ node hopr -b
// Welcome to HOPR!
//
// Available under the following addresses:
//  /ip4/127.0.0.1/tcp/9091/ipfs/16Uiu2HAm5xi9cMSE7rnW3wGtAbRR2oJDSJXbrzHYdgdJd7rNJtFf
//  /ip4/192.168.1.106/tcp/9091/ipfs/16Uiu2HAm5xi9cMSE7rnW3wGtAbRR2oJDSJXbrzHYdgdJd7rNJtFf
//
// ... running as bootstrap node!.
```
This node allows the other nodes on the network to find each other. We will start these nodes next.

## Run HOPR

Now that everything is set up, open a new terminal window (or tab) and you should be able to run a new HOPR node via
```
$ node hopr 0

// Welcome to HOPR!
// 
// Available under the following addresses:
//  /ip4/127.0.0.1/tcp/9095/ipfs/16Uiu2HAkzuoWfxBgsgBCr8xqpkjs1RAmtDPxafCUAcbBEonnVQ65
//  /ip4/192.168.0.167/tcp/9095/ipfs/16Uiu2HAkzuoWfxBgsgBCr8xqpkjs1RAmtDPxafCUAcbBEonnVQ65
//  /ip4/192.168.0.14/tcp/9095/ipfs/16Uiu2HAkzuoWfxBgsgBCr8xqpkjs1RAmtDPxafCUAcbBEonnVQ65
// 
// Own Ethereum address: 0x32C160A5008e517Ce06Df4f7d4a39fFC52E049cf
// Funds: 100 ETH
// Stake: 0 ETH
```
You can then follow the on-screen instructions to stake funds (just hit `[enter]` twice to confirm that you want to stake and then add 0.1 ETH to the payment channel smart contract).

Repeat this step 3 more times so that you have a total of 4 HOPR nodes running. Make sure to change the parameter `0` that you entered the first time to `1`, `2`, `3` the following times. This starts the HOPR nodes with different private keys and lets you send messages from one to another.

## Use HOPR
If all went well this far you have 4 HOPR nodes running (plus a bootstrap node, plus your Ganache instance which is usually a very silent window). Now you are ready to explore the HOPR command line (you can always hit `[tab]` to see available commands or auto-complete):

### Crawl Network
You can actively crawl the network which asks the bootstrap node for available connections:
```
> crawl
['16Uiu2HAkzYUU8dqzQGFkQDMwBc371X84mkYHrFKMGkdZev6tkxzi']: Received 3 new nodes.
['16Uiu2HAkzYUU8dqzQGFkQDMwBc371X84mkYHrFKMGkdZev6tkxzi']: Now holding peer information of 3 nodes in the network.
```

### Check Your Addresses
Sometimes it is good to know your own Ethereum and HOPR address:
```
> myAddress
Ethereum:	0xeb53DDd1Fa419C457956ce7a707073A13377A002
HOPR:		16Uiu2HAkzYUU8dqzQGFkQDMwBc371X84mkYHrFKMGkdZev6tkxzi
```
You can use the HOPR address to send messages to this client from another client.

### Send Message
Open one of the other 3 HOPR nodes and send a message to the first node - first type `send [HOPR_ADDRESS]` and hit `[enter`, then type the message that you want to send and again hit `[enter]`:
```
> send 16Uiu2HAm9cCi8zuTY43J63udgoRMqiUDXXb18wQhge1ztc6v8Yyj
Sending message to 16Uiu2HAm9cCi8zuTY43J63udgoRMqiUDXXb18wQhge1ztc6v8Yyj
Type in your message and press ENTER to send:

``` 
There is a lot going on during this first message that we sent. HOPR needs to open payment channels to the next downstream node via which they relay the message to the recipient. Now is a good time to inspect the two intermediate nodes and see how they see the incoming payment channel request and open a payment channel themselves to the next downstream node.

---------- New Message ----------
Message "Hello from HOPR!" latency 1019 ms.
---------------------------------
```

The latency of the initial message is always longer than the following messages as we open payment channels on demand. The production release will open payment channels before sending messages to reduce latency but on the other hand there will be some (configurable) artificial delay to allow for efficient packet mixing and thus privacy.

# Public Testnet - Here Be Dragons! 🐉

The first public testnet has a few caveats and is likely going to be frustrating to test. You have been warned but you will get extra love for moving on. One major issue that we are currently solving is the missing NAT traversal which currently prevents you from receiving messages behind a router, mobile hotspot or alike. You also need to fund your account and adjust settings as outlined below.

**⚠️ Please keep in mind that currently you can only use the public HOPR testnet with a public IP. If you are using a computer behind a wifi router or mobile hotspot then this is usually not the case. Consider testing HOPR on a virtual private server using a cloud provider able to issue your machine a public IP. ⚠️**

## Get Kovan Ether
The public HOPR testnet is running on the Ethereum Kovan testnet so that you do not have to pay real Ether. Get yourself some [Kovan Ether from the faucet](https://gitter.im/kovan-testnet/faucet). 

## Set Network
Configure your HOPR node to interface the Kovan testnet by setting the network in the `.env` file
```
# Network
NETWORK = kovan
```

## Connect Node (e.g. Infura)
In order to perform any on-chain interactions, you will need a connection to an Ethereum node running the Kovan testnet. Note that using a third party like Infura limits your privacy! For our testnet purposes it is however sufficient.

1. Sign up for [`Infura and obtain your Project ID`](../../wiki/Setup/#Infura).
2. Insert the Infura Project ID into the `.env` file:
```
# Infura config
INFURA_PROJECT_ID = 0123456789abcdef0123456789abcbde
```

## Bootstrap Node
Uncomment the line of the public bootstrap node in your `.env` file and comment the line with the local bootstrap node that you used for the local testnet. In the end that section of the settings file should look as follows:

```
# Bootstrap servers
BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS = /dns4/hopr.network/tcp/${PORT}/ipfs/16Uiu2HAm5xi9cMSE7rnW3wGtAbRR2oJDSJXbrzHYdgdJd7rNJtFf
# BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS = /ip4/127.0.0.1/tcp/${PORT}/ipfs/16Uiu2HAm3WbbQzwcaN7bVG5LRfYPSVXZydkMN6wHk7FZT69heSg7
```
This allows you to configure your own bootstrap node. For the public testnet we are running a public bootstrap node at hopr.network.

## Optional API Keys
If you want to verify the smart contracts that you deploy on Etherscan and you have set `NETWORK` to something different than `ganache` like `mainnet` or `kovan`, please make sure that you have set an `ETHERSCAN_API_KEY` in your `.env` file such that the contract gets verified on Etherscan. This is only required if you want to deploy the HOPR smart contracts in some public Ethereum net.

## HOPR Contract Address
Make sure to set the smart contract address of the HOPR payment channel. Ensure that this address is valid on the network that you chose above. For the Ethereum Kovan testnet we are currently using the smart contract at address [0xebdb4082b08bcef3e286ac4dfc44b8ca61adcc4f](https://kovan.etherscan.io/address/0xebdb4082b08bcef3e286ac4dfc44b8ca61adcc4f).

## Accounts and Keys
HOPR allows can be run in two modes: single account mode or multi account mode. The single-account mode is closer to a production setting and hence recommended for the public testnet while the multi-account mode is useful for testing multiple accounts on the same machine but it has plaintext private keys in the settings file which is a security risk.

### Single Account Mode (Recommended)
Start hopr without any number parameter and it will ask you to provide a password to encrypt the generated private key. It will then generate your HOPR identity and a corresponding Ethereum address.
```
$ node hopr
Welcome to HOPR!

(node:42198) ExperimentalWarning: queueMicrotask() is experimental.
Please type in the password that will be used to encrypt the generated key. ***************

Staked Ether is less than 0.1 ETH. Do you want to increase the stake now? (Y/n):
```
You cannot stake yet as your account has no funds, so go ahead and send some Kovan Ether to the Ethereum address shown on your screen. Then stop the HOPR node via `ctrl` + `c` and restart it once the Kovan Ether arrived.

Next time you start the HOPR node (remember to use the same password as before) you will see your balance. 

### Multi Account Mode
For demonstration and testing purposes, `hopr` allows you to run multiple instances of itself in the same folder and from the same machine so that you can chat with yourself with the integrated PoC chat app. It will create individual database folders for each instance. This is what we were running in the local testnet when starting hopr with the additional parameter `noder hopr 2` accessing the third private key from the `.env` file. You can 

In case you intend to use demo instances with custom keys, make sure that you insert the private keys of these accounts into your `.env` file.

```
DEMO_ACCOUNTS = <number of demo accounts, e.g. 6>
DEMO_ACCOUNT_<number>_PRIVATE_KEY = <private key, e.g. 0x0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef>
```

If you need help when creating Ethereum accounts and/or obtain Testnet Ether, follow these [instructions](../../wiki/Setup/#PrivateKeyGeneration).

## Use HOPR Testnet
Stake some Kovan Ether and then proceed testing in the same way as with the [local testnet](#use-hopr).
